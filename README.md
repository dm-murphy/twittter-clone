# Twittter Clone Project

This "twittter" clone project follows Andy Leverenz's Building a Twitter Clone tutorial. Completed as part of [The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication#your-task-1) curriculum, this assignment covers the use of Devise for authenticating users as well as using Bulma's CSS framework among other Ruby gems. 

This project was built using a SQLite3 database and then converted to PostgreSQL when deploying to Heroku.
